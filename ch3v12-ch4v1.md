## 3:12-4:1
12  Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts,
kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, 13  bearing with one another and,
if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has
forgiven you, so you also mush forgive.  14  And above all these put on love,
which binds everything together in perfect harmony.  15  And let the peace of
Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be
thankful.  16  Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and
admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.  17  And whatever you do, in
word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God
the Father through him.

18  Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.  19  Husbands,
love your wives and do not be harsh with them.  20  Children, obey your parents
in everything, for this pleases the Lord.  21  Fathers, do not provoke your
children, lest they become discouraged.  22  Bondservants, obey in everything
those who are your earthly masters, not by way of eye-service, as
people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.  23  Whatever
you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, 24  knowing that from
the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the
Lord Christ.  25  For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has
done, and there is no partiality.  1   Masters, treat your bondservants justly
and fairly, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.
