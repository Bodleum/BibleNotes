## Notes
 * Shared theme with the earlier section of broken covenants.
 * The word "faithless" is repeated 5 times, and God is also mentioned numerous
   times. The main focus is that God is calling out Israel's unfaithfulness to
   him.

## Helpful References
 * Nehemiah 13:28   -> Example of a marriage to a non-Israelite that was bad
 * Numbers 25:1-13  -> Marrying foreign people is a serious sin; priests should
   be jealous for God.

## Study

1. **What does it mean to be faithful to:**
    1. **God?**
    2. **Spouse?**
    3. **Each other?**
    * Commitment, especially a whole hearted commitment.
    * Keeping your word and promises.
    * Being loyal.
    * Persistence and perseverance.
2. **What is going on in the passage?**
    * *2 main things*
    * Israelites are breaking God's covenant with them by marrying to those who
      don't worship God. **(2:11)**
    * They are divorcing their wives, which God hates. **(2:14-16)**
    * Come back to "cover[ing] the Lord's altar with tears" **(2:13)** later.
    * *[Quickly]* **What's the underlying problem here?**
        * Main point is that Israel is being unfaithful to God, these are just 2
          symptoms of that.
3. *[Longer question]* **Why are these things bad?**
    1. *Intermarriage*
        * Directly against God's commands **(Deut. 7:3-4 and Ex. 34:11-16)**
        * Leads God's people away from him **(Neh. 13:23-29, Num. 25:1-3)**
            * *Another example is Solomon -> married many wives from other*
              *nations and was lead astray.*
        * Children won't be brought up in a godly way, will be acceptable to
          them to worship God along side other gods. **(2:15)**
        * Children can't even speak Hebrew -> a loss of culture and identity as
          a nation. **(Neh. 13:24)**
        * **Is God being racist?**
            * No, this is about what spouses *worship*, not about where they
              are from (i.e. ethnicity or race)
    2. *Divorce*
        * Marriage is a *covenant*, a 3 party agreement: husband, wife and God.
          Breaking that means you are just as unfaithful to God as you are to
          your spouse.
        * God has joined husband and wife together **(2:15)**, divorce
          separates that. **(Matt. 19:6, Mark 10:9)**
        * Jesus' teaching tell us marriage is intended to be permanent, and the
          only acceptable reasons for divorce are things like sexual immorality
          (i.e. cheating, etc.), desertion, abuse etc. **(Matt. 5:31-32)**
        * Additionally, Jesus appeals to **Gen. 1:27, 2:24** for the original
          intention of marriage, stating that divorce was only permitted
          because of their hard hearts, and was not meant to be so. You
          *cannot* divorce for "any cause", and doing so without was committing
          adultery. **(Matt. 19:3-9)**
4. **What is the real problem that intermarriage and divorce are just**
   **symptoms of, and what does this tell us about their attitude?**
    * The Israelites have broken and profaned their covenant.
    * Been unfaithful to God and deliberately broken his commands.
    * **2:13** tells us they "cover the Lord's altar with tears" -> they are
      crying because God isn't accepting their offerings, but are only doing a
      show of religion, their hearts are unchanged - seen in their
      unfaithfulness to their wives **(2:14)**
    * The Israelites respond to God's rejection of them with
      hyper-emotionalism, trying to convince God to accept their offerings
      again (recall that their offerings were substandard anyway). It is too
      little, too late, like a student begging their marker to extend the
      deadline after they didn't write their essay in time.
5. **Where do we see hypocrisy or "fake repentance" in our own lives?**
    * Devotional and prayer lives. How do we pray as much as we like people to
      believe we do? Or read the Bible as regularly?
    * Repeated sins. If we keep committing the same sin over and over, are we
      truly repenting of it and seeking to live godly lives?
    * Attendance to church and church activities. Do we go to church twice a
      week, life groups, prayer meeting, bible studies because we truly want to
      grow in faith, or because we want to look "holy"?
6. [Scenarios](Scenarios.pdf)

#### Extra question covered in the scenarios, but here if there is time to spare:
7. **How can we support those we know who are married?**
    * Pray for them, and their commitment to each other and to God.
    * Don't be a stumbling block to them; i.e. distract from their spouse, sow
      discontent, etc.

## Other Points

*Points which are not in the study, but here in case they come up.*

#### An unbelieving spouse can be saved by they testimony of the other.

This can be true in some instances, and by God's grace someone may come to
faith through a marriage to a Christian. However this does not mean that it is
OK to do so.

* *First, the opportunities for evangelism do not begin at marriage.* It is
  more than possible to evangelise to someone without getting married to them,
  and I personally know of someone who brought her colleague to church and then
  only after he came to faith ever considered marriage.
* *Second, Paul's words in 1 Cor. 7 are directed at those who became believers*
  *subsequent to marriage.* Paul is saying that you should not divorce an
  unbelieving spouse if you come to faith after marriage. They are words of
  encouragement to people already in that situation, not permission to enter
  it.
* *Third, marrying an unbeliever will likely to lead you away from God.* As we
  see in question 3 of the study, intermarriage with unbelievers will almost
  certainly lead us away from God, just as it did for the Israelites in the OT.
* *Fourth, marrying an unbeliever is explicitly commanded against,* both in the
  OT **(Deut. 7:3-4)** and in the NT by Paul **(2 Cor. 6:14:-7:1)**.
