## Notes
 * Shared theme with the earlier section of broken covenants.
 * The word "faithless" is repeated 5 times, and God is also mentioned numerous
   times. The main focus is that God is calling out Israel's unfaithfulness to
   him.

### Helpful References
 * Nehemiah 13:28   -> Example of a marriage to a non-Israelite that was bad
 * Numbers 25:1-13  -> Marrying foreign people is a serious sin; priests should
   be jealous for God.

## Study

1. **What does it mean to be faithful to:**
    1. **God?**
    2. **Spouse?**
    3. **Each other?**
    * Commitment, especially a whole hearted commitment.
    * Keeping your word and promises.
    * Being loyal.
    * Persistence and perseverance.
2. **What is going on in the passage?**
    * *2 main things*
    * Israelites are breaking God's covenant with them by marrying to those who
      don't worship God. **(2:11)**
    * They are divorcing their wives, which God hates. **(2:14-16)**
    * Come back to "cover[ing] the Lord's altar with tears" **(2:13)** later.
    * **What's the underlying problem here?**
        * Main point is that Israel is being unfaithful to God, these are just 2
          symptoms of that.
3. *[Longer question]* **Why are these things bad?**
    1. *Intermarriage*
        * Directly against God's commands **(Deut. 7:3-4 and Ex. 34:11-16)**
        * Leads God's people away from him **(Neh. 13:23-29, Num. 25:1-3)**
            * *Another example is Solomon -> married many wives from other*
              *nations and was lead astray.*
        * Children won't be brought up in a godly way, will be acceptable to
          them to worship God along side other gods. **(2:15)**
        * Children can't even speak Hebrew -> a loss of culture and identity as
          a nation. **(Neh. 13:24)**
        * **Is God being racist?**
            * No, this is about what spouses *worship*, not about where they
              are from (i.e. ethnicity or race)
    2. *Divorce*
        * Marriage is a *covenant*, a 3 party agreement: husband, wife and God.
          Breaking that means you are just as unfaithful to God as you are to
          your spouse.
        * God has joined husband and wife together **(2:15)**, divorce
          separates that. **(Matt. 19:6, Mark 10:9)**
        * Jesus' teaching tell us marriage is intended to be permanent, and the
          only acceptable reason for divorce was sexual immorality (i.e.
          cheating, etc.) **(Matt. 5:31-32)**
        * Additionally, Jesus appeals to **Gen. 1:27, 2:24** for the original
          intention of marriage, stating that divorce was only permitted
          because of their hard hearts, and was not meant to be so. You
          *cannot* divorce for "any cause", and divorcing for any reason except
          sexual immorality is committing adultery. **(Matt. 19:3-9)**
