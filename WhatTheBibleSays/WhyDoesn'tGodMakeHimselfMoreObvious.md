# Why doesn't God make himself more obvious?

Benjamin McClenahan says:

> God has made himself sufficiently obvious to draw the elect to himself through
> the work of the Holy Spirit. He has hidden himself from others for the same
> reason that Jesus spoke to the Pharisees in parables (Matthew 13:10-17) - to hide himself from
> them. Furthermore, even if God made himself more obvious it would not change
> anything. Atheists are atheists because they hate God. Jesus was made incarnate
> as a man, performed miracles fulfilling the prophecies concerning the Messiah
> (I personally find it hard to imagine any way for God to make himself more
> obvious) - and the response of the Jewish leaders and the Romans was to kill
> him.
