# Why do our finite sins deserve infinite punishment?

> One can only commit so many sins, so then isn't it disproportionate to punish
> finitely many sins with an eternity in Hell?

## Response

Firstly, humans are not finite beings - we were created by God to be in a
relationship with him *forever*, and death was not part of the original design.
In Psalm 49, we see that although our body dies, our soul remains forever, with
the righteous being ransomed by God, and the wicked will never see light again.
In John 5, Jesus expands on this by teaching that on the last day, our bodies
and souls are reunited, and the righteous and wicked will be eternally
separated.
So human lives are not finite, but we are immortal creatures (as Lewis reflects
on in *The Weight of Glory*), created for a union in soul and body with God.

Secondly, the severity of a crime depends on who it was committed against -
stamp on and kill an ant, nobody cares; stamp on a dog and people are angry and
upset; kill a baby, even more. And rightly so.
When we sin, we offend God who is infinite and eternal, so an infinite and
eternal punishment is fitting.
Moreover, after the final day, those in heaven will continue to live in eternal
righteousness with God, but those in hell will continually reject and sin
against God - continually incurring God's just wrath.

This reminds us that sins are not small or few, and needs to be dealt with. Sin
is not just the bad things we do, but the good things we leave undone as well,
and further, our relationship with God. Factoring in our actions, words, and
thoughts, our guilt begins to mount up. God's holiness is perfect and sin is
contrary to his character and word. Through the cross, our sins are transferred
to Jesus and his righteousness is transferred to us.
Indeed, when we reject God, we commit, in a sense, an infinite crime by
rejecting an infinite God.

Thirdly, consider the alternatives:

  * God saves everyone (universalism).
  * God destroys those who would go to hell (annihilationism).
  * God, at some point, relents, and lets those in hell into heaven.

Not one of these is in line with the Bible's teaching on creation, sin,
judgement, God's holiness, or the need for Christ's sacrifice.
These all try and play God's love and holiness against each other, but really
they work together, because Jesus came and took the punishment we deserve so
that we would inherit his righteousness and not suffer punishment in hell.
Further, he did this while we were in rebellion to him!
This love doesn't compromise God's holiness though, as those who don't trust in
Jesus as their saviour, rightly still face punishment.
