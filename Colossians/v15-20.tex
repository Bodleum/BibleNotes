\begin{poem}
    \Large
    \begin{stanza}
        {\pmsentence} He is the image of the invisible God,\verseline
        {\verseindent} the firstborn of all creation.\verseline
        {\pmsentence} For by him all things were created,\verseline
        {\verseindent} in heaven and on earth,\verseline
        {\verseindent} visible and invisible,\verseline
        {\verseindent}{\verseindent} whether thrones or dominions\verseline
        {\verseindent}{\verseindent} or rulers or authorities -\verseline
        {\verseindent} all things were created\verseline
        {\verseindent} through him and for him.
    \end{stanza}
    \begin{stanza}
        {\pmsentence} And he is before all things,\verseline
        {\verseindent} and in him all things hold together.
    \end{stanza}
    \begin{stanza}
        {\pmsentence} And his is the head\verseline
        {\verseindent} of the body, the church.
    \end{stanza}
    \begin{stanza}
        He is the beginning,\verseline
        {\verseindent} the firstborn from the dead,\verseline
        {\verseindent}{\verseindent} that in everything he might be pre-eminent.\verseline
        {\pmsentence} For in him all the fullness of God\verseline
        {\verseindent} was pleased to dwell,\verseline
        {\pmsentence} and through him to reconcile\verseline
        {\verseindent}{\verseindent} to himself all things,\verseline
        {\verseindent} whether on earth\verseline
        {\verseindent}{\verseindent} or in heaven\verseline
        {\verseindent} making peace by the blood\verseline
        {\verseindent}{\verseindent} of his cross.
    \end{stanza}
\end{poem}
