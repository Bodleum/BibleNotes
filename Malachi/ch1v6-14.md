Theme: God exposes Israel's half-hearted (read: half-arsed) worship of him,
warning them that this is evil.

Aim: *[For us]* So be thankful to Christ, that we have his righteousness,
driving us to lives lives filled with honour and worship to him.

Study Aim: Read Malachi as a whole, and then focus on the relevant passage.
Draw out the problems with Israel's sacrifices and attitude towards God, and
why this is a problem. Highlight how this is fulfilled in Jesus, and make us
more thankful for him, leading us to be fervent in our worship.

## Study

0. _[Opener]_ **What does it mean / In what ways do we worship God?**
    * Singing
    * Prayer
    * Giving of time and money
    * Living God-honouring lives

*[10 minutes to discuss the next three questions in groups]*

1. *[Quickly]* **What do we see the Israelites doing here?**
    * Offering inadequate sacrifices:
        * Lame
        * Sick
        * Blind
        * Blemished
        * Polluted
        * Taken by violence

2. *[Quickly]* **What does this tell us about their attetude?**
    * Half-hearted service
    * Lack of respect, fear and reverence for God
    * Serving God is wearisome for them
    * God is their last priority - giving him the minimum

3. *[Quickly]* **What does this tell us about God?**
    * Jealous God
    * Deserving of worship, honour and praise
    * Blasphemous worship is an affront to his holiness
    * A great King - feared among the nations (aside: why then is he not feared
      in Israel?)

*[5 mins to recap and discuss next question]*

4. **Why is the Israelites' behaviour and practices a problem?**
    * Against God's commands **(Lev 20:20-22)**
    * Disrespectful and blasphemous to God's holiness
    * Sacrifices are a foreshadowing of Jesus - must be perfect as he was

5. **How does this passage make us thankful for Jesus?**
    * Jesus is the fulfilment of the sacrificial system -> a once and for all
      sacrifice, fully sufficient
    * God looks at us and sees Jesus' righteousness **(1 John 3:1)** -> will
      never say "I have no pleasure in you" **(1:10)**
    * We can be certain of the victory over sin by Christ, we *know* God has
      saved us **(1 Peter 3:8)**

6. **Where in our lives do we see the same attitude as the Israelites had?**
    * Church is boring
    * Can't bothered reading the Bible or praying
    * Frustrated by "Christian Politics" (by that I mean politics within the
      Church)
    * Reluctance to give, especially money

7. **How does this drive us to and how can we encourage in each other fervent worship of God?**
