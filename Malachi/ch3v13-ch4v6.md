## Study

1. **What are the similarities and differences with this complaint compared**
   **with others in Malachi?**
   1. *Similarities*
       * Similar to **2:17**, the Lord is wearied by the Israelites' words
       * Complaints about serving God
   2. *Differences*
       * Answer is not words from God but rather a prophecy about the future,
         it is not vain to serve God because those who do will be spared his
         judgement
       * **2:17** the Israelites complain that God prospers evildoers but here
         they complain that serving him is pointless.
2. **What are the different responses the people take and what are their**
   **outcomes?**
    * Some feared God and esteemed his name. They are God's treasured
      possession, spared judgement and are made distinct.
    * Those who don't will be caught up in God's wrath and judgement, "burning
      like an oven", a consuming fire in contrast with the refining fire in
      chapter 3
3. **What are the assurances God gives the Israelites and how do they answer**
   **their complaint?**
    * **3:17** the righteous will be spared, judgement day will be good for
      them **(4:2-3)**
    * **4:3** they will tread down the wicked, God will have the ultimate
      victory.
    * **3:17** the righteous are God's treasured possession, deeply loved
    * The complaint is answered because these assurances come only to those who
      serve God and obey him, it is far from pointless and vain
4. **To what extent have the prophecies here been fulfilled?**
    * John the Baptist has come (Elijah, see **Matt. 11:14**)
        * He prophesied about Jesus coming, prepared the way
        * Jesus straight up confirms that this prophecy is about John the
          Baptist **(Matt. 11:14)**
        * Wore and ate the same as Elijah
        * Elijah was to call Israel back to repentance and John the Baptist did
          the same, calling people to repent and be baptised.
        * In **Luke 1:16-17** the prophecy is confirmed, the same words are
          used.
5. **How is this passage an encouragement for us?**
    * We inherit Jesus' righteousness, so we can be confident God will spare us
    * Jesus took the curse for us
    * Because of Jesus' death an resurrection, we can be fully confident that
      we are saved
    * God's promises are certain, so we can be certain that this is the future
6. **Why is it worth serving God today?**
    * We deserve this judgement but those who serve the Lord will be spared
    * There is a distinction between us and those who don't serve God
      **(3:18)**
    * If we love Jesus, then we will obey his commands
