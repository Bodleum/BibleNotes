# [Colossians](Colossians.md)

## Background
* Paul didn't start the church in Colossae, and had never been there.
* Epaphras, from Colossae, started the church.
* He had visited Paul in prison, updating on how well the Colossians were doing
  and some of the pressures they were facing.
* Paul wrote the letter to encourage the Colossians, address the pressures and
  challenge them to be more devoted to Jesus.

## General Overview
* Theme: Paul wants Christians to strive maturity in Christ, so that they will
  continually be reminded of their Christ centred faith.
* Aim: Live lives changed by Christ in the present, as though he has already come.

Problem in Colossae, is that there are false teachers. Paul is assured that
they know Christ but they are being tempted to believe that they need Jesus+.
Maturity means that:

> as you recieved Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him (2:6)

**This is the key theme of the book.**

<!-- -->
Paul also makes clear that the fact he is in prison is part of the service of
the gospel and serves to advance it.

### False Teaching

Speculation whether it is from pagans or Jews (or even both).
Rooting ourselves in the text we find:

> See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deciet,
> according to human tradidion, according to the elemental spirits of the world,
> and not according to Christ. (2:8)

Clearly, whatever the false teaching is, it is *not of Christ*.

<!--  -->

Verses 2:16-23 is where Paul's main explanation of the false teaching comes.
This is perhaps the most difficult part of the book.
Paul makes use of Old Testament references.

<!--  -->
#### 2:16-23

In v16, teachers are saying the Christians need to abide by the dietary laws of the OT, continued in v21.

> Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or
> with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. (2:16)
> "Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch" (2:21)

The purpose of these laws in the OT was to be clean for temple worship.
The phrase "festival, new moon or a Sabbath" is centred in the temple in the OT.
These false teachers are focusing on temple worship, insisting the laws are
still applicable; however Paul insists they're not: they were shadows of what
was to come, Christ is the substance of what should be worshipped.

> These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. (2:17)

<!--  -->

Paul continues in verse 18. The asceticism he writes of is when people in early
Judaism thought that more detachment from the world would make you more
spiritually sensitive.
They are talking about an experience in a heavenly temple, not a physical one,
from the mention of worshipping angels (Christ+ angels).

> Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels (2:18a)

<!--  -->

The heart of the false teaching lies in the second half of verse 18:

> Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels,
> going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind
> (2:18)

They thought that if you're really mature and a spiritual Christian (because
they equated those), then you're going to be really involved in the spiritual
world; and if you're not, then you're second class.  The false teachers are
saying that you need special spiritual experiences and visions to make your
faith better, however, Paul refutes this.  He makes clear that Christ is all
the temple experience you need, and Paul makes sure to emphasise
Christ-centredness going into chapter 3.

<!--  -->

The false teachers were saying they were 2nd class citizens because they didn't
have this experience.
Today we could see this in:

* Speaking in tongues makes you more spiritual
* Going to church however many times in a week/Sunday
* Not drinking alcohol or smoking

Paul says to make Christ the centre of your faith and press on towards
spiritual maturity, not letting there be any additions.

<!--  -->

What we should do is identify what the false teaching is by the teaching Paul
presents against it, rather than extra-biblical sources.

<!--  -->
### Union with Christ
#### 3:1-17

Immediately after writing about the false Jesus+ teachings, he begins chapter 3
with emphasising unity with Christ, who is exulted in Heaven. This should
influence our thinking and so we get verse 2:

> Set your minds on things that are above, not on things than are on earth. (3:2)

<!--  -->

Note that in verse 4, Chris is our life *now*, not after we die.

> When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. (3:4)

When we believe, we are represented by Jesus and come into union with him
spiritually, taking on what he has taken on.
Examples:

* Christ is the image of God; we are being conformed to the image of God.
* Christ was sanctified (1 Cor 1:30-31); we are being sanctified through the spirit.

> And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from
> God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, so that, as it is
> written, "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord." (1 Cor 1:30-31)

* 1 Tim 3:16 says Jesus was justified, meaning that after he was judged to
  be guilty and crucified, his resurrection vindicates his righteousness;
  we are represented by his life, which was declared to be righteous.

> ...He was manifested in the flesh, vindicaded [or justified] by the
> Spirit...(1 Tim 3:16)

* Christ was declared to be the son of God (Rom 1:3-4); in Romans 8 and
  Galatians 4, we are adopted sons of God.

> concerning [God's] Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh
> and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of
> holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans
> 1:3-4)
> For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. (Romans 8:14)
> ...God set forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those
> who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.
> (Galatians 4:4-5)

<!--  -->
### In the Household
#### 3:18-4:1

How does this fit into the rest of the letter? Paul has written about Christ's
role in the first and second creations in chapter 1, so why now is he focusing
on the home?
Because Christ has come, and the first household is overturned, now Jesus puts
it back together. Because of the fall, there are obstructions and fractures,
and Jesus comes to restore these relationships.
The home is reshaped with Jesus at the centre.

<!--  -->
### Witness to the World
#### 4:2-6

This is related to the previous paragraph, in that Paul writes that the
believers should "walk in wisdom toward outsiders", and the way you behave in
your home is a part of a witness to others.

<!--  -->
# Studies

<!--  -->
## 1:1-14

* Theme: The gospel the Colossians have heard is true and is bearing fruit
  among them, and in the rest of the world.
* Aim: Be confident in, and keep growing in Christ, living lives pleasing to
  God.

### SLOBS
##### 1->8

**1. What is Paul thankful for in verses 1->8?**

* Their love for all the saints (4)
* The gospel is working in them and the rest of the world (6)


**2. Trace the pathway which leads to Paul giving thanks.**

1. Colossians hear the gospel from Epaphras (7)
2. They respond with faith in Jesus and love for the saints (4)
3. They share the gospel and increase in number (6)
4. Epaphras reports back to Paul and he gives thanks (4)

*This is a good question, tracing the flow of the passage is a useful exercise*

The gospel is spread by ordinary people, nothing flashy.
The Colossians have faith because of the hope laid up for them in heaven. =>
They are driven by an eternal thing


**3. Why do the Colossians need to hear this?**

* Seal of approval, the teaching they had was true.
* Paul grounds his introduction in the gospel.
* Establishes the tone -> Paul is thankful for them.
* Encouragement against false teaching.


**4. Why do we need these verses?**

* Helps us see what sharing the gospel looks like => God changed them, not Epaphras.
* Epaphras is a "faithful minister" (7) who they receive teaching from. Helps
  us feel encouraged that what we have is enough.
* For us, be clear and faithful to the word -> what our friends need is the gospel.
* Be assured by the simplicity of faith, hope and love and be spurred onto a greater faith.

##### 9->14

**5. Write down all the things Paul prays for, then all the things God has done.**

###### Paul
* Increase in the knowledge of God's will (9)
    * Know how God wants them to live.
* Wisdom and understanding of the faith.
* Bear fruit and good works
    * They would actually do good works
    * They would bear fruit (see verse 6) -> a witness
    * **What does it mean to bear fruit?**
* Strengthened to endure opposition.

###### God
* Qualified them: made righteous, justified.
* Domain of darkness to kingdom of the Son, redeemed
    * God has moved us from one geography to another.
* Inheritance: promises made to Israel now apply to them, Gentiles


**6. What does this mean for us?**

* In Jesus, we have full understanding and all blessings.
* An example of how to pray for ourselves and other Christians.
* Keep us on the narrow path, on Christ and him alone.
* Pray for these things but also actively pursue them.
* Paul prays ceaselessly (9) -> challenge to us. Prayer and petition are the
  engine to growth.

-----

<!--  -->
## 1:15-23

Theme: Jesus, who is fully divine and Lord over all creation, has made peace
through the cross, justifying us to be blameless before God.

Aim: Continue following Jesus faithfully/in faith, staying close and true to
the gospel.

### SLOBS
##### 15->20
**1. What do we learn about Jesus in verses 15->20?**

* "Image of the invisible God" (15) => if you know Jesus, you know the Father
  (John 14:7), he *is* God.
* "Firstborn of all creation" (15) => the firstborn has the inheritance rights,
  Jesus has that right over creation, and in him we share a heavenly
  inheritance. The foremost of all creation, the most important.
    * "firstborn from the dead" (18) => Jesus is first of the new creation.
      Adam was the firstborn of the old creation, physical death, Jesus is the
      firstborn of the new creation and eternal life.
* "by him all things were made" (16) => God didn't make things for Jesus as a
  gift or because Jesus couldn't, Jesus has a vital and active role in the
  creation itself. Similar to John 1:3. A statement of the Trinity.
* "all things were made through him and for him" (16) => As above, Jesus had an
  active part in creation, and creation was made to bring glory to him.
* "all things hold together" (17) => He maintains creation and has an active
  role in it to this day. 'He built the car and now he's driving it'
* "reconcile to himself all things" (20) => One day, everything will be under
  Christ's rule. It will be universal and complete whether you accept him or
  not.


**2. Why do the Colossians need this?**

* Who doesn't?! Expands their view of Christ. He has done everything for you,
  you can't add or subtract from him, stay focused.

##### 21->23
**3. What has Jesus done?**

* Reconciled them to God -> complete change of lifestyle. 15->20 is about all
  things, 21->23 is specifically about the Colossians. The glorious and cosmic
  Jesus has done this for them. Jesus' great power has been directed at them in
  love.
* 'if' in verse 23 -> because 23 is true of the Colossians, the previous verses
  also hold true. Faith => reconciliation.
* Paul says, 'Don't shift from the gospel!'
    * **What can tempt us to shift and how do these things compare to Jesus?**
    * **How does this passage speak into that?**

### Notes
*Paul has just finished verse 14 saying we have "redemption" and "forgiveness of*
*sins" in God's Son, but who is he? Paul goes on to describe Jesus in a hymn/poem*
*of praise which leads him to encourage the Colossians to "continue in the*
*faith, stable and steadfast"*

#### Who is Jesus (15->20)
##### Supreme in Creation (15->17)
* Paul starts with "[Jesus] is the image of the invisible God", meaning that
  God has been revealed to mankind through the person of Jesus.
* Paul also says Jesus is "the firstborn of all creation", here using
  'firstborn' as title or rank rather than meaning that Jesus was created.
* Verse 16 tells us why Jesus deserves these titles:
    * Through Jesus "all things were created"
    * Similarly, all creation was made "for him", meaning it is intended for
      his glory, not as a present.
* Everything the Colossians could see, hear, touch, as well as everything in
  the hidden, spiritual realm was created by Jesus, for the purpose of
  honouring him.
* Jesus' part to play in creation is so vital that "in [Jesus] all things hold
  together". Without him, nothing can exist.

##### Supreme in Reconciliation (18->20)
* Amazingly, this same Jesus "is the head of the body, the church" -> he
  directs and cares for his church, just as a head does for its body.
* Here Jesus is "firstborn from the dead", meaning that upon his resurrection,
  Jesus was like the first fruit of God's work to defeat sin, reconciling
  sinful people to him.
* The resurrection is a sign that Jesus is pre-eminent (the most important,
  most powerful), and that God fully dwelt in him.
* He is also the one through which God saves his people, and makes peace with
  all things, in heaven and on earth, by Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.
* His reign will be fully realised one day.

##### Application
* The natural response to this is praise! We read of Paul's excitement!
* Before writing against false teachers, Paul paints a picture of Christ's
  supremacy, which is an important thing for us to keep in mind, esp at the
  start of a new term and stage in life.
* We might sometimes feel like Jesus isn't pre-eminent and faith seems boring
  and mundane, but Paul emphatically reminds us that Jesus is worthy and
  deserving of all our praise.

#### What Jesus has done and Response (21->23)
* Paul brings it down to the Colossians, explaining how it affects them
  personally. "And you ... he has now reconciled."
* God has changed the Colossians "who once were alienated and hostile" and who
  did "evil deeds" now have been "reconciled" to be presented "holy and
  blameless and above reproach before [God]"
* The 'if' in verse 23 is an indication of the response, the gospel they have
  is of Jesus, who has *already* reconciled them.
* False teachers are tempting them to doubt this but Paul encourages them to stay "stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel".

##### Application
* The Colossians are saved by God's work in Jesus, not by earning it.
* Paul still encourages them to be active in their faith.
* **What are some ways we can be active in our faith?**
* We should continue in our faith, standing firm in Christ
* **What can temp us to shift away from Jesus?**
    * Feelings of inadequacy
    * External pressures like doubts
    * Others seeming like 'better Christians' than us
* **How does Paul refute these?**
* God has fully reconciled us to himself solely through Jesus, he is all we
  need, there is no greater hope.


[PDF](v15-20.pdf)

What is typically said of Israel's God, is now said of Jesus.
Jesus has not displaced God, rather revealed and made him known.

### Study
1. **Who Paul writing about in verses 15->20 and how do we know?**
    * 'He' is Jesus, the Son of God.
    * Might appear to be God the Father from the context of the previous verses 12->14
    * "He is the image of the invisible God" -> makes no sense to be the
      Father, be the image of himself? He's also still invisible
    * "making peace by the blood of his cross" -> must be Jesus
2. **Write down all the things we learn about Jesus**
    * "Image of the invisible God" (15)
        * **How can you have an image of something invisible?**
        * God has been revealed to mankind through Jesus.
        * If you know Jesus, you know the Father (John 14:7), he *is* God.
    * "Firstborn of all creation" (15)
        * **Does this mean God made Jesus? / What does Paul mean by this phrase?**
        * No => the firstborn has the inheritance rights,
          Jesus has that right over creation, and in him we share a heavenly
          inheritance.
        * Paul uses this more like a title or rank.
        * The foremost of all creation, the most important.
    * "all things were made through him and for him" (16) => Jesus had an
      active part in creation, and creation was made to bring glory to him. God
      didn't make things for Jesus as a gift or because Jesus couldn't. Similar
      to John 1:3. A statement of the Trinity.
    * "all things hold together" (17) => He maintains creation and has an active
      role in it to this day. 'He built the car and now he's driving it'
    * "head of the body, the church"
        * **What does it mean for Jesus to be head of the Church?**
        * Directs and cares for his church, just as a head does for its body.
    * "firstborn from the dead" (18)
        * **What on earth does this mean?!**
        * Jesus is the first fruit of God's work to defeat sin.
        * Jesus is first of the new creation.
        * Adam was the firstborn of the old creation, physical death, Jesus is
          the firstborn of the new creation and eternal life.
    * "reconcile to himself all things" (20)
        * **What does Paul mean by 'all things'?**
        * One day, everything will be under Christ's rule. It will be universal
          and complete whether you accept him or not.
        * **How do you think this would have made the Colossians feel?**
        * **How does this make you feel? / How is this an encouragement for us?**
            * Meant to be an encouragement if/since we are in Christ.
3. **Why does Paul write this to the Colossians?**
    * Expand their view of Christ
    * Keep them focused on him
    * Remind them of the gospel -> Jesus has done everything for you, there's
      no need to add or subtract from him.
4. **Why is this important for us?**
    * Keep Christ's supremacy in mind at the start of a new year/term/stage of life
    * Sometimes we might feel like Jesus isn't pre-eminent, reminder that Jesus
      is worthy and deserving of our praise.
5. **Compare what the Colossians were to how they are now in verses 21->23**
    * "alienated and hostile in mind" => at war with God, far apart from him,
      completely different to him.
    * "doing evil deeds" => disobeying God's law, immoral
    * "reconciled" => they have a new relationship with God, no longer at war.
    * "holy and blameless and above reproach" => they gain Jesus'
      righteousness, evil deeds have been erased.
    * We see a complete change in lifestyle.
6. **What are some of the things Paul tells the Colossians to do in verse 23?**
    * "continue in the faith" => don't be tempted to leave Jesus.
    * "stable and steadfast" => not turning to the right or to the left.
    * "not shifting from the hope of the gospel" => stay close and true to what
      you've been taught.
    * **What can tempt us to shift and how do these compare to Jesus?**
        * Feelings of inadequacy
        * External pressures like doubts
        * Others seeming like 'better Christians'
        * Paul reminds us that we have been *fully* reconciled to God, Jesus is
          all we need, he has done it all for us.
7. **How does this encourage you to "continue in the faith" and what are some practical ways we can do this?**

-----

## 1:24-2:5
Theme: Paul rejoices in his sufferings in order to spread the gospel, which God
has revealed to the Gentiles, seeking to encourage and strengthen the believers
in Colossae (and Laodicea).

understanding of Christ, who gives wisdom and knowledge, so as no not be lead
astray.

-----

## 2:6-15
Theme: Though once dead in sin, you were raised with Christ being made alive
with God, who has forgiven all our sins by the cross.

Aim: Focus on Christ, so as to not fall prey to false teaching, and live
lives grounded in him, filled with thanksgiving.

### Study
1. **What/who do you look to for fulfilment?**
    * *Maybe will change this to "When you introduce yourself to someone,*
      *what are the first things you say?"*
    * Socialising and my friends
    * Movies/TV or video games
    * Doing well at uni
    * Parents' approval
2. **Recap of what we've seen so far.**
3. **Where does Paul remind the Colossians their identity comes from?**
   **(Previous passages as well, leads off of recap)**
    * They are "saints and faithful brothers in Christ" **(1:2)**
    * God has "delivered [them] from the domain of darkness and transferred
      [them] to the kingdom of his beloved Son" **(1:13)**
    * They are "reconciled" to God, to be presented "holy and blameless and
      above reproach" **(1:20, 22)**
    * They have been "filled in [Jesus]" **(2:10)**
    * They have been "made alive together with [Jesus]" **(2:13)**
4. **In light of this, what does Paul command them to do? (2 main things)**
    * "walk in [Christ]" **(2:6)**
    1. **What does it mean/look like for the Colossians to do this?**
        * Grow in the faith, from "built up in him" **(2:7)**
        * Continue "bearing fruit and increasing" **(1:6)**
        * Be thankful, from "abounding in thanksgiving" **(2:7)**
        * Be active in the faith, from connotations of "walk" **(2:6)** and
          "abound" **(2:7)**
    * Don't let anyone "[take] you captive" **(2:8)**
    2. **Taken captive by what exactly?**
        * Worldly views, from "philosophy and empty deceit", "human tradition"
          **(2:8)**
        * False teaching, not explicit what the teaching is but it is "not
          according to Christ" **(2:8)**, contrary to the gospel they have
          heard.
        * Teachings passed down from possibly pagan religions, from "*human*
          tradition" **(2:8)**
        * "empty" **(2:8)**, meaning there is no truth of fulfilment to be
          found in this teaching.
        * "deceit" **(2:8)**, meaning that it is outrightly false, can lead
          away from the Truth, i.e. Christ.
5. **What reasons does Paul give for this?**
    * Filled in Christ: **(9--10)**
    1. **What are the implications of these verses?**
        * In Jesus, "the whole fullness of deity dwells" meaning that he is God
          in the flesh, and so he is all they need to know God.
        * Moreover, the Colossians have "been filled in him", meaning that they
          have a union with Christ and have been made complete in him. Note,
          they already have this.
        * Jesus is the "head of all rule and authority", meaning that there is
          no power greater than him.
    * Marked out: **(11--13)**
    2. **What does Paul mean when he writes about "the circumcision of**
       **Christ"?**
        * Paul compares physical circumcision to the spiritual action of
          "putting off the body of the flesh". The believers no longer live
          according to the flesh, *(see Galatians 5:24)* but now live in the
          kingdom of Christ.  **(1:13)**
        * The Colossians don't need to look elsewhere for spiritual markers,
          since they already have been marked out by baptism.
        * Baptism represents the death to their sin and then the new life they
          have in Christ. It's a mirroring of Christ's death in their place on
          the cross and subsequent victory over death and sin in his
          resurrection, calling the believers to imitate Christ's behaviour in
          their own lives.
    * Made alive in Christ: **(13--15)**
    3. **How does the resurrection of Jesus encourage us/them to walk in**
       **Christ?**
        * Paul assures them that they need no extra method of removing sin, it
          has been fully dealt with by Jesus' sacrifice on the cross: "forgiven
          us all our trespasses", "cancelling the record of debt", "nailing it
          to the cross"
        * Additionally, Jesus has triumphed over all "rulers and authorities"
          and so the Colossians need look no further for security against
          demonic powers since Christ has "disarmed" them and "put them to open
          shame".
        * Having been made alive in Christ with their sins forgiven, the
          Colossians shouldn't go back to their evil ways, instead seeking to
          live in a way which pleases and honours God.
6. **Paul makes it clear that all Christians are united to Christ (1:18).**
   **What does it look like for us to walk in Christ?**
    * Paul makes clear that the key to spiritual growth is to remain in Christ
      and live like him, and so we also should seek to be "rooted and built up
      in him and established in the faith". How?
        * As a life group, remind each other of the sufficiency of Christ,
          especially when we are struggling.
        * Maintain an active prayer and devotional routine.
        * "Continue steadfastly in prayer" **(4:2)**
        * "Set your minds on things that are above" **(3:2)**
        * "Put to death therefore what is earthy in you" **(3:5)**
7. **What are some of the tempting alternatives to Christ/'Jesus+' we might**
   **see in St Andrews today?**
    * False teachers don't come and announce themselves but come more subtly.
      We should be wary of anyone who presents an alternate program from
      Christ.
    * Some ways we can be lead into false teaching is by people saying "Oh,
      you're not a proper Christian unless you:
        * Go to church twice a week, and go to the prayer meeting.
        * Speak in tongues.
        * Don't drink or smoke.
        * Have a "Damascus road" experience.
        * Have a devotion at least x minutes long.
        * Know about big theological words/concepts.
        * Memorise apologetics.
    1. **How is Jesus better than these?**
8. **According to these verses, what did Jesus achieve on the cross and how**
   **do we benefit from his work on our behalf?**
    * Gives us a 'circumcision of the spirit' **(2:11)**
    * God raised Jesus from the grave and raises us 'with him through faith'
      **(2:12)**
    * "made alive together with [Jesus]" **(2:13)**
    * Forgives "all our trespasses" **(2:13)**
    * Cancelled "the record of debt that stood against us" **(2:14)**, i.e. our sins
    * Triumphed "over [the rulers and authorities]" **(2:15)**

### Study

1. **_Recap_** **Who is Christ and how does he fulfil all our needs?**
2. **In verses 1-4, how does Paul change the Colossians' way of thinking and**
   **why?**
    * *[Follow up question to be dispensed in the ripest moment]* **What does he also remind them of?**
    * Paul encourages them by reminding them of what they have now, and what
      they will have in the future.
        * "raised with Christ" **(3:1)**
        * "Christ is seated at the right hand of God" **(3:1)**
        * "you life is hidden with Christ in God" **(3:3)**
        * "When Christ who is you life appears" **(3:4)**
        * "you also will appear with him in glory" **(3:4)**
        * *[Will explore these in the following bullet points and with various*
          *prompting questions]*
    * "If then you have been raised with Christ" continues from the writings
      about baptism as a symbol of our death to sin and new life in Christ.
    * After writing that "with Christ you died", Paul goes on to write that
      they are also resurrected with Christ, sharing in new life with him.
    * "Christ is, seated at the right hand of God", Jesus is in full authority
      *right now* **(see 1:17, 2:10)** which speaks directly against the Jesus+
      false teachings seen last week.
    * "your life is hidden with Christ in God", their life is secure and their
      salvation cannot be taken away from them *(see Romans 8:38)*
    * "When Christ who is your life", another powerful refute to false teaching
      and reminder that Christ is central. Jesus *is* their life, without him
      they are dead **(2:13)**.
    * "you also will appear with him in glory", an exhortation to seek eternal
      glory and imperishable treasures in heaven over earthly things. The
      Colossians are guaranteed glory and perfection by Christ's work, so why
      focus on earthly things (thinking back to the false teaching we saw last
      week)
    * *[Leads into application]* "seek the things that are above", "Set your
      minds on things that are above", the Colossians should pursue a deeper
      knowledge of and relationship with Christ rather than earthly things.
        * This would look like walking in Christ **(2:6)**, putting God above
          all else **(Matthew 6:33)**, and "holding fast to the Head"
          **(2:19)**
        * Paul will go onto write about very practical ways in which the
          Colossians (and us) can live like Christ, which we will look at in
          the coming weeks (stay tuned!)
3. **In what ways can we, today, grow in our faith by setting our minds on**
   **things that are above?**
    * Prioritise God above all else, i.e. go to Church, read your Bible, pray
      daily, talk about your faith with fellow Christians, and so on.
    * Remember the inheritance you have in heaven **(1:12)**
    * Don't leave 'Christian things' to just a Sunday or Thursday night, make
      it your life, remind yourself of the gospel truths everyday.
    * Read and study the Bible one/two/*n*-on-one, through the week, we have
      brothers and sisters in Christ here to help and encourage us **(2:28)**
4. *[With a superb segue]* **Paul goes on to write very practically about how**
   **to live in a Christ-like manner. From verses 5 to 11, what are they?**
    * Search and destroy all traces of sin in their lives.
    * Paul gives a first list of sinful thoughts and desires, reminding them
      that "on account of these the wrath of God is coming". Such things are
      "idolatry" and are not fitting for those united to Christ.
    * The second list is one of sinful actions, especially speech.
    * Paul writes that they have "put of the old self" (past tense) and so
      should not continue "with its practices".
    * Paul reminds them that "In these you too once walked", and urges them
      strongly to "put to death therefore what is earthly in you". This is a
      hard challenge, because our hearts are fundamentally broken and we have a
      natural desire to stray from God. *[Probably won't bring this up, but*
      *this is my understanding of original sin]* The battle against sin is
      active and ongoing. Paul uses the strongest language for them to make the
      strongest effort.
5. **But by the grace of God we are not alone in this battle! What**
   **encouragements does Paul offer here?**
    * "have put on the new self", they are new creations now, raised with
      Christ **(3:1)** and freed from their record of debt **(2:14)**.
    * "being renewed in knowledge", God is working in them, renewing them and
      giving them increasing knowledge to help fight the battle against their
      sinful desires. He is the one giving them power and growth **(2:20)**.
    * "after the image of its creator", moreover God is continually making them
      more and more Christ-like, and so they are "filled in [Christ]"
      **(2:10)**, more able to resist temptation and assured that the victory
      against sin has already been won on their behalf **(2:13-15)**
    * Paul then shows that the gospel breaks down all barriers between peoples,
      uniting *all* who are in Christ to himself. No matter who they are or
      where they come from, Christ is with them and working in them.
6. **How can this passage help and challenge us in our daily battle with sin?**
    * We are like the Colossians in that our 'old self' is gone and the new has
      come **(2 Corinthians 5:17)**, we are no longer like the world, consumed
      and caught up in earthly desires.
    * If we are in a battle with particular (perhaps recurring) sins at the
      moment, we can be reminded that Christ has ultimately defeated them and
      we are no longer bound to sin, darkness is not forever.
    * *[Quick side note to encourage]* **Romans 8:28-29:** "For I am sure that
      neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor
      things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in
      all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ
      Jesus our Lord", no sins we have ever done, are doing or will do are
      unforgivable, Jesus' love and forgiveness goes far beyond they and we can
      know that we are secured in the love and saving power of Jesus.
    * But we're not in heaven yet! Our battle with sin is very much ongoing,
      and requires daily motivation. We should look to God for our strength
      **(2:19 and Psalm 46:1 (or just all of it))**.
    * We can be spurred on by the complete sufficiency of Christ's atoning
      death and subsequent resurrection, keeping ourselves and encouraging
      others.
