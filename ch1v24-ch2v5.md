## 1:24-2:5
24  Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake and in my flesh I am filling
up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is
the church, 25  of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from
God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, 26  the
mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints.  27  To
them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the
glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.  28  Him we
proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may
present everyone mature in Christ.  29  For this I toil, struggling with all
his energy that he powerfully works within me.

1   For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those at
Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face, 2   that their hearts
may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full
assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ,
3   in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  4   I say
this in order that no one may delude you with plausible arguments.  5   For
though I am absent in body, you I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your
good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ.
