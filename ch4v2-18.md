## 4:2-18
2   Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.  3
At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the
word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison - 4
that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.

5   Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time.  6   Let
your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how
you ought to answer each person.

7   Tychicus will tell you all about my activities. He is a beloved brother and
faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.  8   I have sent him to you
for this very purpose, that you may know how we are and that he may encourage
your hearts, 9   and with him Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who
is one of you. They will tell you of everything that has taken place here.

10  Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas
(concerning whom you have received instructions - if he comes to you, welcome
him), 11  and Jesus who is called Justus. These are the only men of the
circumcision among by fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been
a comfort to me.  12  Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus,
greets you, always struggling on your behalf in his prayers, that you may stand
mature and fully assured in all the will of God.  13  For I bear him witness
that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis.
14  Luke the beloved physician greets you, as does Demas.  15  Give my
greetings to the brothers at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her
house.  16  And when this letter has been read among you, have it also read in
the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read the letter from
Laodicea.  17  And say to Archippus, "See that you fulfil the ministry that you
have received in the Lord."

18  I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be
with you.

Theme: Be wise, knowing your lives are a witness to Christ, being encouraged
knowing that fellow Christians are praying for you, and your spiritual
maturity.

Aim: So pray diligently, remembering the rest of Christ's body, welcoming them
as your own when they come.

### Study
1. **Recap**
2. **What are the main commands Paul gives the Colossians in verses 2-6?**
    * Steadfast and watchful in prayer. **(4:2)**
        * Similar to what Jesus teaches in **Mark 14**
        * **What would this look like?**
        * Meaning be diligent, active, alert, don't be lazy.
        * Being thankful and watchful removes the idea of earning salvation.
          Also keeps prayer from being self-centred, compare with **James 4**
        * Could mean watching for Christ's return?
        * Paul asks them to pray for his evangelism and to make the gospel
          clear, while he is in prison. Remember the last time Paul was in
          prison? Philippian Jailer **(Acts 16)**
    * "Walk in wisdom towards outsiders" **(4:5)**
        * Be an active witness to non-Christians
        * Language of salt reminds of Jesus' teaching in **Matthew 5**
        * Paul assumes they are in contact with outsiders, being part of the
          wider community.
        * Remember that everything you do is seen by others, so live for Jesus
          **(Recall 3:23)**
        * Use their time wisely, not wasting it but using it intentionally and
          deliberately to honour God and serve him.
3. **Who can we be witnessing to (this week) and how can we adopt this type**
   **of active prayer?**
    * Friends in halls, from course, sports teams, other societies.
    * Invite them to church, (carol service!!) or CU events.
    * Offer to read the Bible with them.
    * Be gracious and godly in everyday life, not being ashamed to live out the
      gospel.
    * Pray each and every day for opportunities and for specific friends.
    * Give thanks for what God is giving us, uni is a great open door.
    * **Share some people, challenges and joys**
    * Come back and pray about these at the end.
4. **What picture of the wider church does Paul paint in the remaining**
   **verses?**
    * Welcome fellow Christians
    * Look out for each other, in prayer and encouraging one another in your
      evangelism and Christian maturity.
    * This is a practical outworking of **3:11**, people from all over, all
      part of Christ's body.
    * Be encouraged by the work of the gospel all over the world.
5. *[Similar to last one, possibly to be used as a follow up question]*
   **What kind of things should the Colossians do in response to this?**
    * Encourage and welcome others **(4:8,10,14-15)**
    * LOTS of prayer, Paul doesn't stop going on about it! Prayer for the
      maturing of others, assurance and strength of faith.
    * Partnering with other churches, sharing teaching and encouragement,
      visiting them.
6. **Who can we be praying for and encouraging outside our own church bubble?**
    * Other churches in St A, CS, Vineyard, Baptist.
    * Churches in Cupar, Montrose
    * Missionaries in other countries
    * **Who can we give thanks for, knowing they are continually praying for us?**
    * Church staff and elders
    * Fellow life-groupers
    * **Who can we be invested in inside our church?**
    * Pray for fellow students
    * Church staff and elders
    * Not students and families
    * Older people in the congregation
    * Leaders of the Wed life groups
