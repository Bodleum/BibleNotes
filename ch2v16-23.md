## 2:16-23
16  Therefore let no one pass judgement on you in questions of food and drink,
or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath.  17  These are a
shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.  18  Let no
one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in
detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, 19  and
not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit
together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from
God.

20  If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as if
you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations - 21  "Do not
handle, Do not taste, Do not touch" 22  (referring to things that all perish as
they are used) - according to human precepts and teachings?  23  These have
indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and asceticism
and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence
of the flesh.

Theme: You have died and been resurrected with Christ (metaphorically) and so
are part of his body, no longer subject to the laws of other teachers.

Aim: Therefore, don't submit to false teachings and extra rules, instead stay
in Christ, receiving spiritual growth and nourishment from him.
