# Thoughts on Revelation

## 1
* **v1** God is revealing to Jesus so he can in turn show us?
* **v5** "firstborn from the dead", Colossians language. Did John read Paul's
  letters?
* John seems to be using language from the vision he saw in his introduction.
  He repeats the phrases himself before we as a reader hear the original.
    * "who is and who was and who is to come"
    * "seven spirits"
* **v10** What does he mean by "in the Spirit"?
* **v13** Sounds like the fiery furnace from Daniel
