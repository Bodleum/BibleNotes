# Thoughts on Revelation

## 1
* **v1** God is revealing to Jesus so he can in turn show us?
* **v5** "firstborn from the dead", Colossians language. Did John read Paul's
  letters?
* John seems to be using language from the vision he saw in his introduction.
  He repeats the phrases himself before we as a reader hear the original.
    * "who is and who was and who is to come"
    * "seven spirits"
* **v10** What does he mean by "in the Spirit"?
* **v13** Sounds like the fiery furnace from Daniel

## 2
* Why are the letters written to the angel of the church, and not to the church
  itself?
* Who is "the one who conquers"? Is it whoever obeys what Jesus says here?
* Lots of very similar themes to what Paul writes, especially in Colossians.
* Jesus reminds Ephesus that he is the head of the church, and is in control.
  He opens with "The words of him who holds the seven starts in his right hand,
  who walks among the seven golden lampstands.", he's the one in charge and who
  has the power. Ends with a warning that unless they repent, he will take away
  their lampstand, which seems to mean there won't be a church in Ephesus any
  more.
* The church in Smyrna is reminded that Jesus is "the first and the last, who
  died and came to life.". Jesus has complete power over life and death, and
  even though some of them might die, they will not be lost, since Jesus has
  saved them, he will give them "the crown of life", promising they "will not
  be hurt by the second death", i.e. they will go to Heaven. Very similar
  teaching to in **John 11:25-26**, "I am the resurrection and the life"
* Jesus warns the church in Pergamum to repent and stay clear of the false
  teachings, saying that he will come and wage war against them. His weapon is
  "the sword of [his] mouth", which I think is his word, similar to what Paul
  writes in **Ephesians 6**. I'm not sure what the hidden manna and the white
  stone with a new, unknown name are about.
* Thyatira. Eyes like flame of fire perhaps symbolise that Jesus knows and sees
  into people's hearts, not sure about the feet.
* Does Jezebel refer to one specific false teacher or a brand of them?
* Rod of iron language similar to **Psalm 2**
* Here the "he who has an ear" comes after "the one who conquers" which breaks
  the pattern of the others for the first time.

## 3
* The church in Sardis seem to be half-hearted in their works, they are not
  complete before God. Jesus speaks of coming like a thief against them,
  echoing what he says in **Matthew 24**. A similar kind of theme to the church
  in Ephesus, although here there seem to be some people who are still
  foll/owing Jesus faithfully, "who have not soiled their garments".
* To the church in Philadelphia Jesus praises them for keeping his word and not
  denying him, even though they are small. What is the door he is opening for
  them? Is it the growth of the church? If no-one can shut it, does that mean
  it will definitely happen? Also, what is the "hour or trial that is coming on
  the whole world"? Has no-one else kept Jesus' word about patient endurance or
  why is Jesus sparing only the people in Philadelphia?
* The church in Laodecia doesn't realise their sinfulness, and think they have
  it all sorted out themselves. Jesus also rebukes them strongly about being
  lukewarm, meaning half-hearted and lazy in their faith. Jesus will vomit them
  out! What does he mean when he urges them to "buy from me gold refined by
  fire"?

## 4
* What is the door that stands open in Heaven?
* The phrase "in the Spirit" appears again
* What is the significance of the gemstones? And why is there a rainbow?
* What is the sea of glass?
* Why are they specified as 'living' creatures? Isn't it assumed that they are
  alive? Or are they living in the same way Jesus describes himself as "the
  living one"?
* Why are these animals, lion, ox, eagle and the face of a man, chosen?
* Why do they have so many eyes?
* Who are the 24 elders? 12 tribes + 12 disciples?

## 5
* What is the scroll, what does it represent?
* Why can the one on the throne not open the scroll?
* The elder describes him as a lion, but John looks and sees a lamb.
* The lamb is worthy because he ransomed people for God.
* Singing a new song is similar to language in the psalms, **Psalm 40, 96, 98**
* Every creature, humans and animals it seems, is worshipping the lamb.

## 6
* Why does all this happen as the Lamb opens the seals? What to the seals mean?
* The first horseman conquers, perhaps symbolising nations like Babylon and
  Rome?
* The second horseman seems to represent war and conflict.
* The third horseman has scales, maybe comes to judge? Also the food is really
  expensive, so maybe famine? Why does the voice say not to harm the oil and
  wine?
* The fourth horseman kills a quarter of the earth by the sword, and with
  famine and disease. Why?
* God will not avenge the martyrs under the altar until they're all there.
  Sounds similar to the parable of the wheat field in **Matthew 13**.
* At the sixth seal, the world ends pretty much, the people will do anything to
  escape the wrath of the Lamb. Even the most powerful kings are running to
  caves and wishing the mountains would fall on them.

## 7
* What are the winds of the earth, and why are they being held back?
* Why are 144,000 sealed then right after there is an innumerable multitude?
* Aside: If John really did see 'the future' and saw the new creation, then he
  might have seen me there, pretty cool.
